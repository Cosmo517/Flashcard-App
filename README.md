## Flashcard App

## Lab 2

### App Description
This simple app asks a single question, and allows the user to tap the question to reveal the answer, tap one of the multiple choices which will highlight the answer, reset the answers, or hide the visibility of the visible answers. New functionality was added to allow the user to replace the question that is asked (and the corresponding answer) with a question and answer of their choosing, or they could edit the existing card. The user can also add multiple choice answers for the question if they wish.
